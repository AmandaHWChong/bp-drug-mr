# Script Prerequisites & Requirements

The data requirements for the script are as follows:

a) Phenotype data for one or more traits, i.e. SBP, DBP, PP, TC, LDLC, TG, CHD, Stroke, hypertension

Phenotype file format.

* First column should be FID/IID.
* Rest of columns should contain available phenotypes, in any order, preferably labelled as follows in " ":
"sbp", "dbp", "pp", tc", "ldlc", "tg", "chd", "stroke", "hypertension",
* CSV format.

b) Complete covariate data such as age, and sex

A covariate file should be provided satisfying the following requirements:

* First column should be IID.
* One column should contain age (years), defined as year of the survey minus YoB and labelled as "age".
* One column should contain sex, labelled as "sex". Males should be coded as 1 and females as 0.
* One column should contain medication use status for blood pressure, labelled as "medication_hypertension". Individuals on anti-hypertensive medication should be coded as 1 and the others as 0.
* e column should contain medication use status for LDLc, labelled as "medication_hypertension". Individuals on lipid lowering medication should be coded as 1 and the others as 0.
* CSV format.

c) Genomic principal components (~ 20 PCs)

A PC file should be provided satisfying the following requirements:

* First column should be IID.
* Up to twenty columns containing the first 20 genomic principal components. Note that it is potentially possible to alter the primary analysis to include less principal components for computational efficiency.
* Preferably labelled in capital letter.
